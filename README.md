# CHATBOT
# Dialog-based ChatBot using DialoGPT
This Python script implements a dialog-based ChatBot using the DialoGPT model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The ChatBot engages in a conversation with the user, responding to user inputs with generated responses from the pre-trained DialoGPT model. The conversation continues until the user decides to end it by typing "bye", "quit", or "exit".

# Features:
1. **Interactive Chat**: Allows users to interact with the ChatBot by typing messages.

2. **End Conversation**: Provides an option for users to end the conversation at any time by typing "bye", "quit", or "exit".

3. **Pre-Trained Mode**l: Utilizes the DialoGPT-medium model from the Hugging Face model hub, which is pre-trained on large-scale conversational data.

4. **Random Responses**: Generates random responses if the model fails to generate a response or if the user input is not understood.


# Usage:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the repository containing the Python script.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that all required dependencies are installed, including numpy, torch, transformers, and any other libraries used in the script.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script in a Python environment. This can be done in a local Python environment or in a cloud-based environment like Kaggle.

4. **Start Chatting**: Follow the prompts to start a conversation with the ChatBot. Type messages and press Enter to send them to the ChatBot.

5. **End Chat**: To end the conversation, type "bye", "quit", or "exit". The ChatBot will respond accordingly and terminate the conversation.


# Dependencies:
Python 3.x

**numpy**: For array manipulation and random sampling.

**torch**: For tensor operations and deep learning functionality.

**transformers**: For accessing pre-trained language models from the Hugging Face model hub.
